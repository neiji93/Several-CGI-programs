//according to physics, there must be several explanations about each scene cases.
//Then, using directly models will be easier because we can extract latent variables.
//If the complexity of drawing eaach elements of the scene that is concern increase, 
//we will be able to extract data that are latent variables here. It involves solving many problems
//To adress control theory without using AI, we will use differential equations. Then, latent variables
//must be used with differential equations (old researches).


//In CG, we can negate a model if we increase textures number if I'm not wrong.
//Here, we will have to add shadows. As in CG shadow mapping refers to techniques,
//any models is suited to delete hand written shadows. Navier stokes equations are relevant
//here because datas can be replaced for some of them.

//The imaging techniques should be avoided in a near futur. To cancel them,
