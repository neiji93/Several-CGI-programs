//according to physics, there must be several explanations about each scene cases.
//Then, using directly models will be easier because we can extract latent variables.
//If the complexity of drawing eaach elements of the scene that is concern increase, 
//we will be able to extract data that are latent variables here. It involves solving many problems
//To adress control theory without using AI, we will use differential equations. Then, latent variables
//must be used with differential equations (old researches).
