//To do that, preventing earth model which is the worst case will be good. exp(3*x) is contained in 
//some open source tools because it can describe some algorithms and earth model can be avoided by 
//using desaturating images (look CityWorldMapFromCGI.... repository). To merge exp("*x) and desaturate
//tool, we will use exp(3*x) twice. Then, in physics, we will use exp(3*x) three times....(old maths researches -
//some kind of absurd reasonning).
